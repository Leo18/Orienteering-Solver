Orienteering-Solver
===================

Java solutions for WorksApp 2014, including both an orienteering game and an ImmutableQueue. The algorithms and implementations are inspired by wikipedia and other geeks.
Both exams are solved in this project.
The IDE I used here is IntelliJ Idea 13 Community Edition.
The JAVA version on my Mac is 1.8, but all the sources have been compiled and tested using JDK 7.
The src folder contains JAVA source code for both exam 1 and exam 2.
The structure of the code is as following:
Orienteering.java    - entry point of the solution for exam 1.
AStarPathFinder.java - Path finding tool used for orienteering.
Point.java           - Point class.
MapGenerator.java    - Random grid map generator used to test exam 1.
ImmutableQueue.java  - Implementation of immutable queue for exam 2.
All the sources contain a static main method for unit testing.
